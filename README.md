# Testing System

Course project, completed by me at the STEP Academy. For this work I received
12/12 points, teacher: Vasilenko Igor Grigoryevich.

The main idea of the project is the decomposition of the subject area, in the
field of testing students. It was necessary to project completely from scratch.

As UI - WPF is selected, with the MVVM architectural pattern.

As a DBMS - SQL Server.

As ORM - Entity Framework.

The project is implemented on the .NET Framework.

The project is raw and not a "model repository", the only thing I want to note
is the database structure, IoC containers and an independent strategy for
working with windows on WPF.
